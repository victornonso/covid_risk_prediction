# 🦠 COVID-19 Risk Prediction Model

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a COVID-19 infection based on symptoms and demographic factors. Developed as part of a healthcare data science initiative by eHealth Africa, this model provides insights into risk factors and serves as a foundation for building intelligent screening tools.

## 🎯 Objective

Build and evaluate predictive models that can classify individuals as COVID-19 positive or negative based on self-reported symptoms and demographic details.

---

## 📊 Features & Highlights

* ✅ **Predictive Models**: Implements Logistic Regression , Random Forest, XGBoost and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
* 🔁 **Cross-Validation**: Prevents overfitting and ensures reliable results.
* 📈 **Performance Metrics**: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
* 🧪 **API Integration**: Flask-powered REST API for inference.
* 📉 **Visualizations**: ROC curve, confusion matrix, and feature importance charts.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove pending results and missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Convert birth year to age, encode categorical fields.
3. **Modeling**: Train and evaluate Logistic Regression & Random Forest.
4. **Evaluation**: Use test data to compare metrics and choose the best model.

## 🗃️ Dataset

Collected from Hocus Pocus town by eHealth Africa. Fields include:

* **Demographics**: Age, Sex
* **Symptoms**: Binary indicators like cough, fever, loss of smell, etc.
* **Result**: COVID-19 test result (Positive or Negative)
